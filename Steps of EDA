1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Understand data structure, types (numerical, categorical), distributions, and relationships.
   * Visualize data using histograms, box plots, count plots, etc.
   * Detect missing values and outliers.

2. **Handle Missing Values**

   * Impute using mean, median, or mode.
   * Use strategies based on outlier presence and data distribution.

3. **Handle Outliers**

   * Detect via box plots or IQR method.
   * Remove or cap them based on context.

4. **Data Cleaning**

   * Remove redundant or irrelevant features.
   * Normalize formats (e.g., convert duration `2h 50m` to minutes).

5. **Feature Scaling**

   * Standardize or normalize numerical data so all features are on the same scale.

6. **Convert Categorical to Numerical**

   * Use label encoding or one-hot encoding.
   * Reduce high-cardinality features smartly.

7. **Handle Imbalanced Data**

   * Use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE.

8. **Feature Selection**

   * Choose important features using correlation, chi-square, KNN, genetic algorithms, or tree-based methods.
   * Avoid the "curse of dimensionality" by reducing irrelevant features.
